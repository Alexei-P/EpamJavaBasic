Three things to keep in mind with delta:

1. Delta tends to increase as you get closer to expiration for near or at-the-money options.
2. Delta is not a constant, a fact related to gamma, our next risk measurement, which is a measure of the rate of change of delta given a move by the underlying.
3. Delta is subject to change given changes in implied volatility.

There are some additional points to keep in mind about gamma:

1. Gamma is smallest for deep out-of-the-money and deep in-the money options.
2. Gamma is highest when the option gets near the money
3. Gamma is positive for long options and negative for short options (as seen above in Figure 5 with our example of a short call)

Some additional points about theta to consider when trading:

1. Theta can be very high for out-of-the-money options if they contain a lot of implied volatility.
2. Theta is typically highest for at-the-money options
3. Theta will increase sharply in the last few weeks of trading and can severely undermine a long option holder's position, especially if implied volatility is on the decline at the same time.

Additional points to keep in mind regarding vega include the following:

1. Vega can increase or decrease even without price changes of the underlying because implied volatility is the level of expected volatility.
2. Vega can increase from quick moves of the underlying, especially if there is a big drop in the stock market, or if there is a sudden upward burst in a commodity like coffee after a reported frost in Brazil.
3. Vega falls as the option gets closer to expiration.
